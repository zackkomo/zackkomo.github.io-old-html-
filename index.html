                    Hello! My name is Zack Komodromos. I am currently a student at Iowa State University.
                    I will be graduating in Spring 2021 with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering with a Minor in
                    Computer Science. I plan on attending Graduate School in Fall of 2021 focusing on Electrical Engineering
                    Communications and Signal Processing. My goal with that is to equip myself as best I can in order to be
                    working on cutting edge research in the Communications field.
                    <br>
                    <br>The purpose of this website is to have a centralized place to showcase any projects or content I
                    want to make available for anyone to see. My main interests are more geared toward Communications in
                    Electrical Engineering, but I do like taking on other types of projects. One
                    example is this website! With this website, I will also showcase some projects I have completed in my 
                    Undergraduate degree as well as some reflections on my goals and path.
                    <br>
                    <br>Here is my <a href="./assets/files/Resume.pdf">resume</a> but if you would like to know more, I encourage 
                    you to take a look at the rest of the website!

                    During my junior year, through taking EE330, I learned a lot about the manufacturing process for
                    integrated circuits. Along with
                    that, I gained insight in designing different circuits, mainly focusing on amplifiers. For the
                    final project in the course, another student and I completed one of the final projects. Our
                    prompt was
                    to create a device like the Maxim DS 1666, where there are 4 modes of operation. Through a 2-bit
                    input the user will be able to switch between the different modes. In mode 00 it operates like a
                    noninverting finite gain amplifier, in mode 01 like a programmable inverting finite gain
                    amplifier, in mode 10 like
                    a 4-bit DAC and finally in mode 11 like as a potentiometer and operational amplifier. We quickly
                    simplified the
                    process by identifying the common aspects and made a Transmission Gate (bi-directional voltage
                    controlled switch), a 4-to-1 Multiplexer, an Operational Amplifier, a Resistor Array and a
                    4-to-16 Decoder. Following
                    are the presentation slides and final report that explain the project in more detail.

                    For my Cpre281 Final Project my sophomore year, we were given a choice of a few projects. I decided
                    to go with "Booths Multiplication". The basic idea of the algorithm is a way of multiplying two
                    numbers in two's compliment. A summary of the algorithm is: you start with one of the numbers as a
                    running number and add the multiplier or the multiplicand based on the last two digits of the
                    running number. Each iteration of the process will shift the number to the left and repeat the
                    process for as many times as there are binary digits. For my project specifically, I used the Altera
                    DE2-155 board in such a way that a user would input two 8-bit numbers using 16 switches on the
                    Altera board, and then the multiplication of the two would show up on the HEX display of the board.
                    This project helped me get very familiar with using Digital Logic to get the results I want, as well
                    as designing basic level FSMs (Finite State Machines). For the project I used various collections of
                    systems that I had made throughout the semester, like a Fast Adder, the 7-Segment display output, as
                    well as a Register File to hold the numbers.

                    <h4>Personal Project: Discord Bot</h4>
                    <p>
                        As an Electrical Engineering student, I do not get much opportunity to do software-based
                        projects. Completing Computer Science classes for my minor gives me some exposure but not much.
                        Since I use discord, I decided to make a bot to help in some situations. To work on my project I
                        used Node JS, the Discord API, GitHub to host my code and a local machine acting like a server.
                        The code for the bot can be found <a href="https://github.com/zackkomo/zBot">here</a> . Through
                        this project I learned a lot about scripting languages, asynchronous functions, and JavaScript
                        syntax. Additionally, I gained valuable experience using an API, as well as setting up CI/CD
                        through GitHub's actions to actively update the live bot if changes are made to the repository.
                        Some of the functions I made include: Reminders, Polls, Channel Creation and an RNG.

                <h2>Senior Design</h2>
                <p> In the final year at Iowa State University all ECpE students are part of a senior design team that is tasked
                    with completing a project. My team consisted of a total of 6 people. The name of the project was "Wake-up Harvester 
                    Design for Batteryless IoT System" and the website the university provided for it is <a href="http://sdmay21-14.sd.ece.iastate.edu/">here</a>.
                </p>
                <div class="project">
                    <p>
                        As the name suggests, our project is to create an Internet of Things device that can be woken up. The project itself is
                        seemingly simple, but the more you look at the constraints it presents the more it starts becoming a project. The
                        purpose of the project is to create a system to support a microprocessing unit. This unit is fully accessible to the
                        user to use as they see fit. To power the MCU, a harvesting unit is required. This allows the whole system to act as a
                        wireless self-reliant system. In order to make this an IoT device, it also has the capability of receiving and
                        transmitting data. Given this setup, the only additional feature is the ability to “wake-up” the device when necessary
                        for synchronization or any reason a user may want to.
                        <br>
                        <br>My role in the project is fluid, as is everyone in the project. I have worked with everyone on the team to create a high
                        level design of our system. In addition to this, I was tasked with finding a number of components we will end up using
                        in our design. The process helped me gain experience in looking for components that need to match specifications while
                        also being reasonably priced and able to interact with other components in the system. In addition to this, we will be
                        conducting data gathering tests of which I will be in charge of one. After that I will work with Altium PCB Designer to
                        create schematics for parts of the project as well as contribute to the PCB layout of our IoT device.
                        <br>
                        <br>Overall, my contribution is more focused on helping with confirming the overall design and performing the test to
                        confirm our design’s feasibility. While I have contributed to the overall design, I will probably not play a major role
                        when it comes to the PCB layout. I will need to familiarize myself with the layout, however, since testing will involve
                        me having to know the placement and connections withing the PCB. This will definately increase my knowledge on using
                        Altium PCB Designer and also testing procedures and equipement like Osciloscopes and devices to test the transmission and
                        receiving capabilities. For more details on the process or the project itself, you can refer to our project’s website.

                    EE330: Integrated Circuits class. Some of my responsibilities included leading labs
                    of around 15 students. Constructing new howmework problems as well as re-writing labs
                    for an online platform. In addition to these responsibilities, I was in charge of grading 
                    a portion of the homeworks and lab reports. Through this work experience, I learned how to
                    work in an online setting, help students with difficult material as well as being accountable
                    to keep a schedule for grading and attending lab sections.

                    At Cemen Tech I worked as an Electrical Engineering Intern. My primary role was updating
                    schematics in CAD and also reworking some assembliess in SolidWorks. During my internship there,
                    I design, tested, and realeased new features for their primary product. This gave me a lot of 
                    experience on following a project through from design to testing to release. One of the final
                    projects I worked on was revising and reworking a PCB Board that was contracted for manufacturing
                    that would be used on one of their products.

                    involved me reviewing circuit analysis material from the first classes of Electrical Engineering. In 
                    addition to this, i also aided my tutees in understanding how to study properly and help themselves
                    outside the course. One of the goals I had while tutoring was to be able to share my point of view

                </h2>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    One of my biggest goals going through the education system is to get the most I can out of it. Fortunately, I live in a
                    time where the standard is to provide a "well rounded" education where my degree requires me to take courses outside my
                    major, and even outside my discipline. As an engineering student, I felt that my education doesn't talk about a lot of
                    societal situations and more people-oriented education. This is precisely why my 5 general education courses involved 2
                    courses in sociology (SOC 135 & 331), 1 in psychology (PSYCH 101), 1 in African American studies (AFAM 201)as well as
                    one on Russia in the last 100 years (RUS 375).
                    <br>
                    <br>In my sociology classes, I learned a lot about how society in general functions, and the underlying reasons that lead to
                    how we function today. Going through a course that talked about the different reforms that happened to transition people
                    from a societal-less existence to slowly forming communities and then further into whole countries helped me put things
                    into perspective. In addition to this, talking about the different types and forms of government, the benefits and
                    detriments of each and how the people benefited from each was important. This gave me the perspective that not
                    everything is perfect, as well as the fact that society keeps changing. Our needs as citizens change and thus the
                    response and support communities provide should also change to reflect that.

                    <br>In my psychology course I went through the basics of behavioral psychology and how some things can be attributed to
                    biology while other things cannot. One of my favorite activities in the class was having to find an article to read
                    relating to current research in psychology and reading up and writing a short report on it. Being introduced to a field
                    which I have no understanding over, and cannot see myself having an understanding, even though it affects my day to day
                    life provides a new angle of seeing things. Being able to identify my own patterns and breaking from intuition to
                    reevaluate some decisions is an essential skill to have, since my goal is to conduct research on new and cutting edge
                    technology. Being able to take a step back and identify assumptions and biases I have will prove an essential tool in
                    making breakthroughs, even in the simplest of actions.
                    <br>
                    <br>In the AFAM class I took, I learned much about the history of how Africans were shipped to North America (among other
                    places) as well as the slavery and inhumanities that took place. Being able to understand the past aided in giving me an
                    understanding on current events. During this class, and recent unrest relating to the content covered in the class, I
                    learned a lot about systemic racism as well as other forms. The issue is definitely not a knew one, and clearly is not
                    one that can be solved in an instant. Being exposed to the facts about the past won’t help me understand what some
                    people go through on a daily basis, but can at least put me in a better situation to check myself and carry myself in a
                    way that will not offend or antagonize people around me.
                    <br>
                    <br>Finally, in the RUS 375 class I learned about how much I don’t know about the world. The reason behind me taking the
                    class is, I had seen it on a list and then realized that I knew absolutely nothing about how Russia came to be, as well
                    as that I knew next to nothing about the Soviet Union. The feeling also translates to my own major, since there are many
                    subfields withing Electrical Engineering that I have not even been exposed to. Going through the class content slowly
                    gave me an understanding on current situations as well as clarifying misconceptions I had about events in the past. In
                    terms of my major, it motivated me to try to familiarize myself with as much as I can about all the different subfields,
                    and be aware that I may have misconceptions about them that may not be true.
                    <br>
                    <br>All these classes contributed to a more well rounded and reflective education. While taking 5 classes hardly makes me
                    knowledgeable in any of the contents of the classes or their subsequent fields, it helps expose me to new areas that I
                    didn’t have the chance to through my major.

                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    A large portion of the early 100-level courses I took as an Electrical Engineering student at ISU focused on growth of
                    an individual person’s learning. In a world where new technologies are always around the corner, more specialized
                    personnel is needed and where we are reaching the limits to what we can do in many fields, future engineers face an
                    uphill battle through their whole career. Staying in tune with the current standards is not an easy task, and one that
                    requires more than just being told it or reading about it.
                    <br>
                    <br>Lifelong learning, and actual learning at that, is a difficult process. Fortunately, rather than just being taught
                    subjects, my professors over the years have taught me how to learn. The process is most evident in labs that I have
                    taken as well as final projects. Being given a problem to solve that takes more than a few hours can be an overwhelming
                    experience at first. One of the skills I have gained through my lab and project experience is to take things one step at
                    a time and break things up in a productive and sequential way. This skill was most evident to me when I worked on a
                    project during my internship and managed to complete it satisfactorily in the timeline I was told even though initially
                    I felt the weight of the responsibility of being assigned a larger assignment like that.
                    <br>
                    <br>Another large takeaway from my classes here is the way professors carried themselves when asked a question they did not
                    initially know the answer to. There were multiple professors that, when asked a question during class that was outside
                    the scope of the class, would pause and think before giving an answer or announce that they would look into it and come
                    back to us. Seeing professors act that way helped me understand that it is acceptable to not know everything even if you
                    might be expected to since it is unreasonable. Beyond that, you have a responsibility as an engineer to find answers
                    when you are made aware you don’t know. This skill is one I applied as a Teaching Assistant for EE330. There were
                    multiple times where I was asked questions that I did not know the answer to. My actions in these cases are a result of
                    seeing my professors go through similar situations, since I would review class materials, past notes or find resources
                    on my own to answer.
                    <br>
                    <br>When a student goes through classes and receives high grades it is easy to fall in the trap of feeling like you know
                    everything there is to know. In the last 4 years, I have learned that this is definitely not the case and there is
                    always more to learn. This realization has fundamentally changed my learning process, since I try to make sure
                    everything I learn is truly learned and not memorized. In addition to that, I try and add more breadth to my knowledge
                    so that I am at least aware of different options. For me, this is most evident since I pursued a minor in Computer
                    Science. As an Electrical Engineering student, I had to take a class on C programming and then a class later on where we
                    applied that in an embedded systems course. I realized early on this is not enough exposure to the more programming side
                    of things, so I decided to pursue the minor in order to spread out my experience and knowledge in a way that will make
                    future learning and problem solving easier.
                    <br>
                    <br>Overall, there are many fields where lifelong learning is necessary. In terms of Electrical Engineering, I believe after
                    4 years I have put myself in a situation where I can sustainably keep learning as new discoveries and standards come to
                    be. Beyond that, through the experience I gained I am able to truly learn things rather than do so on a surface level.
