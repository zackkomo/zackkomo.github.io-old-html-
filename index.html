                    Hello! My name is Zack. I am currently a student at Iowa State University.
                    I will graduate in Spring 2021 with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering with a Minor in
                    Computer Science. I am a meber of the Honors Program at ISU, as well as a member of IEEE - Eta
                    Kappa Nu.
                    <br>
                    <br>The purpose of this website is to have a centralized place to showcase any projects or content I
                    want to make available for anyone to see. My main interests are more geared toward Communications in
                    Electrical Engineering, but I do like taking on other types of projects. One
                    example is this website!

                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>Most classes that have a lab component, at ISU, have a final project at the end. Through these
                    final projects I get to apply everything I 've learned from the class to come together for a
                    design that I fully make on my own or with a group of other people. I enjoy these projects since
                    it is a great way of turning theory into practice as well as get tangible results for my
                    efforts.
                </p>
                <p>Beyond just class projects, I have worked on projects on my own time, both to improve myself but
                    also to explore new interests. These include using APIs or even making this website. Below are
                    some
                    of the projects I have worked on.

                    During my junior year, through taking EE330, I learned a lot about the manufacturing process for
                    integrated circuits. Along with
                    that, I gained insight in designing different circuits, mainly focusing on amplifiers. For the
                    final project in the course, another student and I completed one of the final projects. Our
                    prompt was
                    to create a device like the Maxim DS 1666, where there are 4 modes of operation. Through a 2-bit
                    input the user will be able to switch between the different modes. In mode 00 it operates like a
                    noninverting finite gain amplifier, in mode 01 like a programmable inverting finite gain
                    amplifier, in mode 10 like
                    a 4-bit DAC and finally in mode 11 like as a potentiometer and operational amplifier. We quickly
                    simplified the
                    process by identifying the common aspects and made a Transmission Gate (bi-directional voltage
                    controlled switch), a 4-to-1 Multiplexer, an Operational Amplifier, a Resistor Array and a
                    4-to-16 Decoder. Following
                    are the presentation slides and final report that explain the project in more detail.

                        For my Cpre281 Final Project my sophomore year, we were given a choice of a few projects. I
                        decided to go with "Booths Multiplication". The basic idea of the algorithm is a way of
                        multiplying two numbers in
                        two's compliment. A summary of the algorithm is: you start with one of the numbers as a running
                        number,
                        and add the multiplier or the multiplicant based on the last two digits of the running number.
                        Each itteration of the proccess will shift the number to the left and repeat the proccess for as
                        many times as there are binary digits. For my project specifically, I used the Altera DE2-155
                        board in such a way that a user would input two
                        8-bit numbers using 16 switches on the Altera board, and then the multiplication of the two
                        would show up on
                        the HEX display of the board. This project helped me get very familiar with using Digital Logic
                        to get the results I want, as well as designing basic level FSMs (Finite State Machines). For
                        the project I used various different collections of systems that I had made throughout the
                        semester, like a Fast Adder, the 7-Segment display output, as well as a Register File to hold
                        the numbers.

                    <h4>Personal Project: Discord Bot</h4>
                    <p>
                        As an Electrical Engineering student I do not get much opportunity to do software based
                        projects. Completing Computer Science classes for my minor gives me some exposure but not much.
                        Since I use discord, I decided to make a bot to help in some situations. To work on my project I
                        used Node JS, the Discord API, Github to host my code and a local machine acting like a server.
                        The code for the bot can be found <a href="https://github.com/zackkomo/zBot">here</a> . Through
                        this project I learned a lot about scripting languages, asynchronous functions and JavaScript
                        syntax. Additionally, I gained valueable experience using an API, as well as setting up CI/CD
                        through GitHub's actions to actively update the live bot if changes are made to the repository.
                        Some of the functions I made include: Reminders, Polls, Channel Creation and a RNG. </p>
